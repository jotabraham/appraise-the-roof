          In the Appraise the Roof game, first you are prompted to submit a city and
          state (i.e. Grand Rapids, MI). Upon submission, the game populates a
          random selection of 10 houses. Your task is to "Appraise the Roof!" Guess
          the listed sale price and submit your answer. You are awarded points based
          on the accuracy of your appraisal.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are stumped and would like a hint, they are provided. However, each
          hint costs valuable points that reduce your final score. After 10
          appraisals, submit your High Score to see how you rank as an Appraisal
          Expert! The highest possible score is 1,000 points (unless, you get an
          EXACT appraisal - play again and again to see what happens).

          And remember, these homes are actually for sale! Hit the SIMple diamond on
          a home of your liking to save it to your own Favorites section (where we
          provide addition details and a link to the listing).
